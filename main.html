	      <p>Hello!<strong> My name is Gayani Anuththara Jayarathne,</strong> and I’m an enthusiastic <strong>undergraduate computer science </strong>student at the <strong>Informatics Institute of Technology in Sri Lanka.</strong><br> 
		     I am passionate about exploring technology to solve real-world problems and improve daily life through innovation.
		     I have actively participated in project work that enhances my practical skills while building a solid foundation in <strong>programming, data structures, algorithms, and software development.</strong>Furthermore, 
			 I have built up deep knowledge about<strong> Java, Python, HTML, and JavaScript and C++</strong>
		     I'm dedicated to constantly advancing my technical knowledge in order to stay up with the rapidly changing field of computer science, and I enjoy learning new frameworks and technologies.<br>
			 In my free time, I explore open-source communities and contribute to small projects, which help me learn from real-world codebases and understand industry practices.
			 <strong>Along with my coursework, I take an active part in group projects and coding competitions that help me improve my problem-solving and teamwork skills.</strong> 
			 <strong>I'm especially interested in fields like cybersecurity and Artifial Inteligance.</strong>I have developed good communication and organizational skills, which help me manage tasks effectively and build strong working relationships. 
			 I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a professional environment where I can support the team while expanding my knowledge and experience.
			 <strong>In future I aspire to become software architect</strong> and build software solutions that make a meaningful impact and work in a dynamic environment where continuous learning and innovation are encouraged.
